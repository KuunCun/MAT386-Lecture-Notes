| **Reproducibility (15)**: All required files are provided. Jupyter Notebook files runs without issues and reproduce the necessary outputs. Data is in the data folder and is loaded from this folder in write-up. Jupyter Notebook is well structured and easy to follow. Code is correct, easy to read, properly formatted, and properly documented. |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |       |
| **Introduction (25)**: The introduction provides a clear explanation of the question and the dataset used to answer the question, including a description of all relevant variables in the dataset.                                                                                                                                                   | when a categorical variable has too many categories, it is better to merge less frequent ones into a single category (of course, we should do this without data leakage after train-test split) |       |
| **Approach (50)**: The chosen analysis approach and visualizations are clearly explained and justified. The visualizations are appropriate, easy to read, and properly labeled. The methodologies are correctly implemented.                                                                                                                          | lr = LogisticRegression()-->default fits lr with ridge penalty   cv=5, --> use KFOLD splitter rather than passing the integer                                                                   |       |
| **Discussion (10)**: Discussion of results is clear and correct, and it has some depth without being excessively long. References are given.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |       |
